🏗️ System Architecture: Multi-Class Disease Prediction System
The architecture is split into three main logical tiers, ensuring modularity and maintainability, which aligns with the technical expectations of your project.

1. Presentation Tier (Frontend)
This is the user interface where the user (Doctor/Analyst) interacts with the system.

Technology: Python web frameworks like Streamlit or Flask with simple HTML/CSS are ideal for quick prototyping.

Components:

Data Input Interface: A form where the user enters clinical features (e.g., age, blood pressure, specific lab results).

Result Display: Shows the predicted disease class, the probability scores for all classes, and potentially a visual of feature importance.

2. Application Tier (Backend/Business Logic)
This tier handles the core logic, coordinating data flow and executing the AI model. This is where your three major functional modules  reside.

Technology: Python (Flask or FastAPI for a dedicated API, or integrated within a Streamlit script).

Components:

Data Preprocessor Module: Receives raw input from the Presentation Tier. It performs required steps like scaling, normalization, and handling missing values, which were defined during model training.

Prediction Service/API: This is the core module. It loads the serialized machine learning model (e.g., a .pkl or .h5 file) and uses the preprocessed data to generate the multi-class prediction.


Reporting Generator: Takes the raw prediction output (probabilities) and the original input data to construct the final diagnostic report, ensuring a clear input/output structure.

3. Data Tier (Storage)
This tier is responsible for persistent storage, supporting both the system and the model.

Technology: SQLite (simple for local projects), or PostgreSQL/MySQL. Filesystem for model artifacts.

Components:

Model Storage: Directory or cloud storage holding the trained model artifacts and the necessary pre-processing pipelines (e.g., the trained StandardScaler).

Historical Data/Audit Log: Stores historical prediction requests and results for future auditing, evaluation, and potential retraining. This is where the Database/Storage Design  applies.

🗺️ Mapping to Project Requirements
This architecture directly supports your submission requirements:

Requirement	Architecture Component

Three Major Functional Modules 

Data Preprocessor, Prediction Service/API, Reporting Generator (all in the Application Tier).

Proper Architectural Design 

Clear separation into Presentation, Application, and Data Tiers.

Error Handling Strategy 

The Application Tier is responsible for validating inputs before they hit the model.

Database/Storage Design 

Handled by the Data Tier (Audit Log/Historical Records).
